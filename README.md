# SauceLab web automation Katalon and BDD
This is a sample project web automation testing using Katalon with BDD cucumber

### Behavior-driven development (BDD)
[Behavior-driven development (BDD)](https://docs.katalon.com/docs/general-information/supported-integration/supported-integration-overview/bdd-testing-framework-cucumber-integration-overview) Behavior-driven development (BDD) testing framework allows you to create test cases in plain English. BDD testing framework focuses on the behavior of the product and user acceptance criteria. Cucumber is a BDD framework tool to write test cases, which uses Gherkin, an ordinary language parser, that permits writing scripts in English./
The integration of the Cucumber framework in Katalon Studio allows you to include Cucumber test hooks, which work at the start and the end of a scenario in a behavior-driven development (BDD) test. To learn more about test hooks in the Cucumber framework, you can refer to Cucumber document:/

With the BDD testing framework in Katalon Studio, you can:

* Create or add a feature file.
* Define and link steps.
* Set the default package for step definitions.
* Run your feature file.
* Add your feature file to a test case.
* View BDD report files generated from Katalon Studio.
* Upload and view BDD reports on Katalon TestOps.

## Working with BDD feature files in Katalon Studio
### Add Feature Files
This section shows you how to add feature files in Katalon Studio. Steps in the scenario will then be defined by step definitions./
### Maintain Features File
For better management, you might want to organize your feature files with a multi-level system. A feature file can contain many scenarios. However, you should have one scenario per feature file for easy maintenance./
In Katalon Studio, there are three options to help you maintain the feature file. Right click anywhere in the feature file editor view and choose from the following options:/

     |<center>Option</center>|  Description|
     |---------------------|:--------:|
     | Pretty Format   | Re-do the format when the current format is not organized properly. |
     | Find Step   | Find relevant step of current Gherkin step in existing Step Definitions files.  |
     | Recalculate steps   | Recalculate steps in the feature file when there are changes in Step Definitions.  |
         
### Define Steps
### Set the default package for step definitions
### Run a Feature File
